# d Orbitals

The 3d orbitals are the simplest d orbitals and will be the focus of this section. 4d and 5d orbitals are also important when looking at transition metal chemistry and the topics discussed apply to them as well. 3d orbitals (l=2) have 5-fold degeneracy since <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle m_l"> can take values of 0, ±1 and ±2. As n=3 and l=2, they have 2 angular nodes and no radial nodes. 

The 5 different 3d orbitals are called the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xy}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{yz}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xz}">,<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{x^2-y^2}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{z^2}"> and have more complicated shapes than the 1s and 2p orbitals. The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xy}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{yz}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xz}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{x^2-y^2}"> are similar in shape while the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{z^2}"> is quite different. 
 


### The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \textbf{d_{xy}}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \textbf{d_{yz}}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \textbf{d_{xz}}"> orbitals

All these orbitals lie in the stated plane and the lobes sit in between the axes of that plane. For example, the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xy}"> orbital lies in xy plane and the lobes sit in between the x and y axes. Thus, for the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xy}"> orbital, the nodes are the x=0 (yz plane) and y=0 (xz plane). This pattern is repeated for the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{yz}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xz}"> orbitals. 

Shown below are two views of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xy}"> isosurface plot showing the angular nodes. The red and blue lobes show the change in phase.

### The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \textbf{d_{x^2-y^2}}"> orbital

A first glance the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{x^2-y^2}"> looks identical to the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xy}">. Both orbitals sit in the xy plane but it is important to note that the lobes of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{x^2-y^2}"> lie along the x and y axes, not in between them as is the case for the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xy}"> orbital. The angular nodes this time are the planes defined by the equations x=y and x=−y as shown by the isosurface plots below.

### The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \textbf{d_{z^2}}"> orbital
Perhaps the most distinctive d orbital, the shape of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{z^2}"> is quite different to all the other d orbitals. It has two lobes along the z axis and has a torus (“donut shaped”) lobe of opposite phase surrounding the nucleus in the xy plane. Three views of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{z^2}"> are shown below.

It is not immediately apparent where the 2 angular nodes are. In fact they are cones with their tip at the nucleus extending at out at an angle of<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle \approx 57^o"> from the z axis. This is perhaps more clear when the contour plot of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{z^2}"> in the xz plane is viewed (below).
