# d Orbitals

The 3d orbitals are the simplest d orbitals and will be the focus of this section. 4d and 5d orbitals are also important when looking at transition metal chemistry and the topics discussed apply to them as well. 3d orbitals (l=2) have 5-fold degeneracy since <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle m_l"> can take values of 0, ±1 and ±2. As n=3 and l=2, they have 2 angular nodes and no radial nodes. 

The 5 different 3d orbitals are called the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xy}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{yz}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xz}">,<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{x^2-y^2}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{z^2}"> and have more complicated shapes than the 1s and 2p orbitals. The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xz}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xy}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{yz}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{xz}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{x^2-y^2}"> are similar in shape while the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle d_{z^2}"> is quite different. 
 



All lie in the stated plane and the lobes sit in between the axes of that plane. For example, the dxydxy lies in the xyxy plane and the lobes sit in between the xx and yy axes. Thus, for the dxydxyorbital, the lobes are the x=0x=0 (yzyz plane) and y=0y=0 (xzxz plane). This pattern is repeated for the dxzdxz and dyzdyz orbitals. 
Shown below are two views of the dxydxyisosurface plot showing the angular nodes. The red and blue lobes show the change in phase.
