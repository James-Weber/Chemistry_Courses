# Wavefunction Energies

Even though a wavefunction depends on its unique values of the quantum numbers <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_l">, the situation is simplified for a 1-electron system and the energy of wavefunction, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E_n">,  depends only on <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">:
 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E_n=-\frac{R_HZ^2}{n^2}\rightarrow E_n\propto-\frac{1}{n^2}"> 
 
Where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R_H"> is the Rydberg constant (just a number) and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Z"> the nuclear charge (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Z">=1 for H)
 
The energy is negative since we define an electron free of the effect’s of nucleus as having zero energy. We can make a comparison to gravitational potential energy of a particle in a radial gravitational field which is often covered in high school. In this case, the potential energy of the particle is zero at an infinite distance from the large mass causing the gravitational field (in other words when it is outside the gravitational field) and the becomes more negative as the particle approaches the large mass. 

This energy equation has two important consequences.

**Firstly**, as it makes no reference to the quantum numbers <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_l">, all orbitals with the same principal quantum number <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> will be degenerate (of same energy). For example, the 2p and 2s orbitals will be degenerate, the 3s, 3p and 3d will be degenerate and so on. This is not the case when we start adding more electrons as we will discuss later. 
 
**Secondly**, the dependence on <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{1}{n^2}"> also means that the energy difference between levels is not constant. The biggest energy gap is between the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">=1 and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">=2 levels, then between the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">=2 and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">=3 levels and so on. The energy gaps are seen from the energies of observed transitions between levels. 

## Series 

1. By far the biggest factor in determining a transition's energy (and therefore its place in the electromagnetic spectrum) is the lower energy level. This leads to several "series" of transitions which produce lines in the emission spectrum. In a particular series, all transitions have the same lower level. Some transitions in the hydrogen emission spectrum have special names:
Lyman → <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">=1,  
Balmer → <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">=2 

2. In a particular series, the non-linear energy level spacing leads to unequal spacing of the lines. As the energy levels converge, the transition energies get closer together, leading to the spectrum lines lines converging.
