# p Orbitals

p orbitals are triply degenerate. This can be seen from the value of l which is 1 for p orbitals and the resulting degeneracy given by 2l+1=3. All p orbitals have one angular node and n−1 radial nodes. 

We shall focus predominantly on the 2p orbitals here with a brief reference to 3p orbitals at the end. The 2p orbitals are the  simplest orbitals and, as they are key orbitals used in the bonding of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen (important elements in organic chemistry), gaining a solid understanding is very useful. 

The 2p orbitals resemble a 3-dimensional “figure of eight”. They lie along the x, y, or z axes and are called px, py and pz respectively. Shown below is an isosurface plot of the 2pz orbital. The angular node at the nucleus means that the wavefunction changes sign (phase) when r=0 and the 2 distinct regions of the orbital, one at z>0 (yellow) and the other at z<0 (purple) are coloured differently to reflect the different phases. Regions of different phase in the same atomic orbital are often termed "*lobes".

It is important to understand that it is arbitrary as to which phase we assign as positive and which as negative. However, it becomes important when we consider the overlap between atomic orbitals because the interaction between atomic orbitals (or parts of atomic orbitals) of the same phase will produce different results than interactions between orbitals of opposite phase (see Molecular Orbital course). 


### Radial Part

The radial part of the 2p orbital can expressed:

From the lone "r" term it is clear the wavefunction will be zero at the nucleus. This means that, unlike s orbitals, there is precisely zero probability of finding the electron at the nucleus. The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle e^{-r^2}"> term is symmetrical about the origin, in other words <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle e^{-r^2}=e^{-(-r)^2}"> . However, the lone "r" term is clearly not symmetrical about the origin so we know that the wavefunction will change sign as we cross the origin - this is the "phase change". 

This phase change along the z axis is also shown in the 1-dimensional plot below where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle r=z ">.

### Angular Part 

The precise mathematical form of the angular part of the wavefunction is different for the 2px, 2py and 2pz, explaining their different orientation. However, all three have an angular node in the form of a plane which includes the origin. For the 2pz, this angular node is the xy plane (also called the z=0 plane). The 2pz wavefunction is zero everywhere on this plane and, as the plane includes points of varying distance from the nucleus, we know this node cannot be radial. 
 
The contour plot shows the angular node in the z=0 plane as well as the reflective symmetry of the orbital above and below the angular node.

### 3p orbitals

The 3p orbitals (n=3, l=1) have one angular and one radial node and are therefore harder to visualise. 
Certain plots are straightforward such as looking at the wavefunction along a coordinate axis as done here for the 3px3px. 
 
In terms of their wider behaviour when bonding, the 3p orbitals (and those with higher n) still have the same general shape, lying along one of the three coordinate axes with a phase change at the nucleus.
