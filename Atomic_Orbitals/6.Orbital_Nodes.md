# Orbital Nodes

Nodes are points or planes where the wavefunction of an atomic orbital is zero: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi(x)=0">. Knowledge of orbital nodes is important because nodes provide some constraints on where the electrons in a orbital can and can't be as well as affecting the overlap between atomic orbitals when molecular orbitals are formed (discussed in Molecular Orbitals course).  
There are two types of nodes: radial and angular. As the names suggest radial nodes arise when the radial part of the wave function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R(r)=0">.  and angular nodes when the angular part of the wave function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Y(\theta,\phi)=0">.

For an orbital with quantum numbers <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n,l,m_l,m_s"> there are several rules we can apply to determine the number of nodes the orbital has.

**1. Total number of nodes = n-1 ** \
1s with n=1 has 0 nodes \
2p with n=1 has 1 node 
 
**2. Number of angular nodes = l** \
s orbitals (l=0) have 0 angular nodes \
p orbitals (l=1) have 1 angular node \
d orbitals (l=2) have 2 angular nodes \

**3. Number of radial nodes = total nodes – angular nodes = n−1−l ** \
For example, a 3p orbital (n=3, l=1) has 3-1=2 total nodes, 1 angular and 1 radial.

The nodes will be indicated as we review the different types of orbital in the next sections.
