# 1. Shells, Sub-shells & Quantum Numbers

Chemical reactivity, the formation and destruction of chemical bonds, is determined to a large extent by the energy of valence electrons - the highest energy electrons found in an atom - since these are the electrons almost invariably involved in bonding. Therefore, to understand the behaviour of elements, we need to understand their electronic structure.
When looking at how electrons are arranged in atoms, in high school you will first encountered the concept of shells. Using this methodology the electron configuration of, for example, chlorine would given as 2, 8, 7 where 2, 8 and 7 refer to the number of electrons in the shells.
This basic description can be improved by splitting each shell into one or more sub shells. These sub shells are termed s, p, d and so on. These letters refer to the atomic orbitals which makes up each sub shell. Depending on the syllabus covered in high school, you may have covered atomic orbitals but as some curricula do not, this is where this course will start. 
Atomic orbitals form the simplest units of electron arrangement in an atom - each atomic orbital can hold up to 2 electrons although we often need to consider atomic orbitals which hold one or no electrons for bonding purposes. Within an atom, each atomic orbital is unique (has a unique set of three quantum numbers - see below) but can be categorised as a particular type of orbital (s, p, d etc). 
Each type of atomic has a characteristic shape and, depending on the syllabus, you may have discussed how the overlapping of orbitals leads to bond formation. We will explore the idea of atomic orbitals further in this course and formalise your understanding.

## Quantum Numbers 
Every electron in an atom has a unique set of 4 quantum numbers - 3 of these describe the atomic orbital the electron resides in and the 4th4th refers specifically to the electron. 
The 4 quantum numbers are:
1. Principal quantum number, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">
2. Angular momentum quantum number, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l">
3. Magnetic quantum number, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_l">
4. Intrinsic angular momentum quantum number (spin), <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_s">

## Principal Quantum Number, n
The values of nn corresponds to the shell containing the electron. The valence electrons in the 1st1st period (H, He) are in the n=1n=1 shell, those in the 2nd2nd period (Li…Ne) are in the n=2 shell and so on. Matters are complicated by the introduction of d orbitals later on but this is beyond the scope of the course. 
Returning to the example of chlorine's electron configuration of 2, 8, 7; the "2" electrons are found the n=1n=1 shell, the "8" electrons in the n=2 shell and "7" electrons in the n=3n=3 shell.
n takes integer values starting at 1 ⟹ n=1, 2, 3, 4….

## Magnetic Quantum Number, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_l">
Each orbital can contain a maximum of 2 electrons. Consider the 2nd2nd period (nn=2) which contains only s and p orbitals but 8 electrons. There must be multiple s and/or p orbitals to accommodate these.
This brings us to the 3rd quantum number - the magnetic quantum number, mlml. This takes values from −l to l in integer steps and tells us the about the orientation of the orbital. There are therefore 2l+1 values of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_l"> for a particular value of l. 
For example, p orbitals have l=1 so mlmltakes values of -1, 0, 1. Therefore, there are 3 degenerate (of same energy) p orbitals (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_x">
, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_y">
, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_z">) which can hold 6 electrons in total, allowing the period to accommodate 8 electrons. 
 
## Intepretation of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l">
 and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_l">
When an electron moves around the nucleus, it has angular momentum associated with it, much like a planet has angular momentum as it orbits the Sun. l tells us the magnitude of the angular momentum and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_l">
 tells us its orientation which allows us to differentiate between orbitals of the same type (e.g. between <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_x">and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_y">). 
 
## Intrinsic Angular Momentum Quantum Number
So far we have looked at 3 quantum numbers (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n,l,m_l">) which tells us the shell, type of orbital (s, p, d etc.) and particular orbital an electron occupies. But each orbital can hold 2 electrons so how do we differentiate between them? 
We need to look at the electron’s spin (intrinsic) angular momentum, s, which can be thought of as the angular momentum due to the electron spinning about its own axis (as opposed to angular momentum due to its orbit). All electrons have <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s=\frac{1}{2}">
so we can ignore this quantum number as it does not differentiate between electrons. 
However, just as with orbital angular momentum, we need to consider orientation as well as magnitude. Orientation is specified by the secondary spin quantum number, , which can take values of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=+\frac{1}{2}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=-\frac{1}{2}"> with one electron in the orbital having <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_s=\frac{1}{2}"> and the other having <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_s=-\frac{1}{2}">. 
To distinguish between <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_s= \frac {1} {2}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m_s= - \frac {1} {2} ">, electrons can be referred to as “spin up” or “spin down”. Diagrammatically, spin up electrons are denoted ↑ and spin down arrows as ↓.
