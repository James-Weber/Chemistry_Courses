# Visualing Orbitals

A function of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> variables function requires <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n+1"> dimensions to be shown. For example, plotting a one dimensional function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y(x)=x^2">requires 2 dimensions (a horizontal axis and a vertical axis). 

Orbitals are functions of 3 variables: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi(x,y,z)"> so we would need 4 dimensions to visualise them fully; 3 dimensions for the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x,y,z"> axes and then a 4th for the value of the orbital at that point in space. This is not practical but there are several ways we can visualise orbitals:

1. One dimensional plots of a single variable
2. Two dimensional contour plots
3. Three dimensional isosurface plots 

These methods are complementary and each have advantages and limitations. 
 
## One dimensional plots of a single variable
This is the simplest plot and one you will be familiar with from high school. It shows the direct relationship between a single variable, xx in the plot shown below, and a function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x)">. 



Its simplicity is a key advantage â€“ spotting a relationship between the variables is quick and easy. However, compared to the other plots (2D and 3D), this method conveys a much smaller amount of information. It tells us nothing about the relationship that may exist between other variables and the function.  This method is particularly useful for examining how a wavefunction may vary in a particular direction, e.g. along the xx axis. 
 
## Two dimensional contour plots
Contour plots allow us to illustrate, in 2 dimensions, how a function depends on two variables. A line on a contour plot joins all points where the function has the same value. 

A common use for contour plots is on maps. The parameter illustrated by the contour is ground height above sea-level and the variables are longitude and latitude (or distance North-South and East-West). Contour lines join all locations with the same height; if one were to walk along a contour, you would remain at the same height above sea-level while the steepest hills are found when contour lines are bunched closely together as at such a place the function (ground height) is changing rapidly in a particular direction. 
The contour plot of the function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x,y)=\sqrt(x^2+y^2)"> indicates how the function behaves in the same manner in any direction in the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x,y">  plane.

## Three dimensional isosurface plots

Isosurfaces are a very common way of representing atomic and molecular orbitals and are typically how orbitals are represented. 


Isosurface plots show 3 dimensional shapes where the surface connects all points where wavefunction has the same value. This can be expressed mathematically as: 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\psi(x,y,z)=a">

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a"> is a constant.

Below is shown the isosurface plot of a 1s orbital. The plot reveals the 1s orbital spherical symmetry - all the points where the wave function has the same value fall over the surface of a sphere. This spherical symmetry is an important factor when bonding via orbital overlap is considered.
